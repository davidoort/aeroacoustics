function [Fcf_u, lambda_u, Fcf_l, lambda_l] = convergeflowfield(flowfield, r, epsilon, coaxial)
%{
AXIAL Flight
convergeflowfield - This function solves for the Prandtl tip loss function
along the span of the blade on the upper and lower rotor as well as the
inflow ratio lambda on the upper and lower rotor. It is called
"converge" because there is an iterative component of getting to the
results since lambda and F mutually depend on each other.

NOTE: Usually converges within 5 iterations.

Inputs:
    flowfield - (struct) containing lambda_inf (array) for both rotors 
    (normalization is different for each rotor since tip speed may be different)

    r - (array) of radial positions from dr to 1-dr

    epsilon - accuracy of convergence (scalar)

    coaxial - (struct object) containing geometrical properties for both rotors such 
    as pitch distribution, radius, rpm, blade number, etc 

Outputs:
    Fcf_u - (array) containing the converged (for a given collective pitch
    setting) Prandtl tip loss function at every blade span for upper rotor

    lambda_u - (array) with converged inflow distribution as a function of
    blade span for the upper rotor

    Fcf_l - (array) containing the converged (for a given collective pitch
    setting) Prandtl tip loss function at every blade span for upper rotor

    lambda_l - (array) with converged inflow distribution as a function of
    blade span for the upper rotor

Other m-files required (in path): 
    get_lambda_up
    Prandtl_tip_loss
    get_lambda_bot

MAT-files required: none

Assumptions:
    ! Top rotor not influenced by bottom rotor: its inflow can be converged
    independently.

    Start at F=1 provides fast convergence.
